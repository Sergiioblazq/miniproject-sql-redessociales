**Social Media Addiction Among Students**
**Objective 🎯**
Our goal is to analyze the factors influencing social media addiction among students through data collection and analysis. Using survey responses, social media usage statistics, and academic performance records, we aim to provide a data-driven understanding of how addiction affects student life.

**Features ⚙️**
Data Cleaning: Processes raw data to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.
Data Visualization: Creates visual representations to identify patterns and trends.
Reporting: Generates summaries and charts to communicate findings effectively.

**Tools Used 🛠️**
Python: Main programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive environment for development.
Git: Version control and collaboration.

**Development Process 📊**
Data Collection:
Kaggle dataset: Students Social Media Addiction.

Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates and missing values.
Standardized usage metrics (e.g., hours per day).

Data Analysis:
Explored key contributors to addiction.
Dataset spans multiple countries and academic levels.
Each row represents an individual student response.
Key dimensions: platform preferences, usage intensity, relational dynamics.
Analyzed correlations with academic performance, mental health, sleep patterns, and demographics.

Data Visualization:
Bar charts, scatter plots, ER diagrams, and normalized datasets for better insight.

**Key Findings 📌**
- Strong links between social media overuse and reduced academic performance.
- Negative impact on sleep quality and mental health.
- Platform-specific trends and differences across age, gender, and education level.

**Summary Report 📄**
Highlights top risk factors such as age group and academic level.
Suggestions for further research:
Longitudinal studies to track addiction over time.
Analysis of social media design features (e.g., infinite scroll, notifications).
Impact of parental guidance and socioeconomic background.
